There are two deployment strategies:

- **Standard** (`cirrus-deployment`): deployment automatically proceeds from pre-production to production on the default branch.
- **Container Release Management** (`container-release`): deployment on the default branch stops between pre-production and production allowing stakeholder review.

You will find options in this guide for Container Release Management configuration. The default instructions are for the standard strategy.

!!! note
    Familiarize yourself with [Container Release Management](../container-release.md) before you proceed in this guide.
