Make sure the following are true before proceeding:

- When your application is built, the result should be a single container image pushed to Cirrus. Currently, applications that output multiple images are not supported.
- Make sure you have an IBM Bluepay consumer account: <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cio-hybrid-cloud-services/get-started/create-accounts" target="_blank">register for an IBM Bluepay account</a>, if you have not. Your manager may have already set one up for you.
- <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/enterprise-application-library" target="_blank">Register for an Enterprise Application Library (EAL) account</a>. You will need the created **IMAP number** later (EAL-XXXXXX).
