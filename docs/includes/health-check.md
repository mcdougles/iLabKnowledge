Configure a **health check** endpoint. You can learn more about [health checks here](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/manage/health-check-apis/). By default the pipeline creates a **liveness** and **readiness** probe calling the endpoint `/health/ping` in order to validate your application is up and running. Your application needs to be configured to respond from this endpoint. The endpoint can be changed by configuring a custom **liveness** and **readiness** probe following this guide: [Cirrus Deployment Customization](../cirrus-deployment-customization.md).
