The following process allows you to encrypt Secrets and commit them securely to your repository.

1.  Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) written by GitHub to generate a token for cio-ci-cd, with permissions:

    - `repo`
    - `user/read:user`

    For your convenience, click [this link](https://github.ibm.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user&description=cio-ci-cd) and it will automatically set up the token pre-populating the permissions for you.

1.  Save the **access token** as you'll need to use it later.
