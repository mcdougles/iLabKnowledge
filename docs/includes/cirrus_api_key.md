Create an API Key for Cirrus. You can create the API key on [this page](https://cirrus.ibm.com/user). Be aware that keys automatically expire after 90 days and there is no way to renew them, so you'll need to periodically replace this key. You should follow the steps on this guide to create an API key: [Accessing Via API Key](https://pages.github.ibm.com/CIOCloud/cio-blog/cli/#accessing-via-api-key). _Ensure you keep a copy of the key created, it will be used in the next step._
