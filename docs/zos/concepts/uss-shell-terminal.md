# USS and Shell Terminal

In order to board the pipeline, your Z system will have a Unix side in addition to it's MVS side.  The Unix side may also be referred to as USS (Unix System Services).

A shell is an interface for accessing an operating system and the terminal is a graphical window on your laptop that enables you to interact with the shell.

With this approach, you will use a command-line interface to work in USS.   In a command line interface, you type text to invoke commands to the system.
