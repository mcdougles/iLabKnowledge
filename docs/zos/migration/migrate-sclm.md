#### Migrating your SCLM Source into a Git Repo
​
This [video](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/IBM+Dependency+Based+Build+CourseB+Migrating+SCLM+to+Git+Demo/1_y0jo6qwl) goes through the process of migrating your source into a Git repo.  Unlike the video, we are only interested in going through phases 1 & 2 of the migration as the last step is for generating DBB scripts, and we don't need those for the pipeline.  For reference, phases 1 & 2 start at the beginning of the video until 16 minutes 45 seconds.  If you would like to follow along, the documentation on these steps is found [here](https://github.com/IBM/dbb/blob/main/Migration/sclm/migrationSteps.md).
