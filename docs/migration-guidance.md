# Migration guidance

!!! note
    z/OS users proceed to the [z/OS overview page](./zos/overview.md)

## Overview
This page contains migration guidance for users coming from **Travis** and deprecated **Cirrus** pipelines, and also applies generally to any new user. If you are new to CIO CI/CD, see our [W3Publisher page](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cio-ci-cd){target=\_blank} for a short and comprehensive overview plus ways to get engaged with the product.  We added more [Office Hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10272011?layout=grid){target=\_blank} sessions to field the increase in questions and concerns.

CIO CI/CD facilitates the corporation mission of ITSS compliance and consistency, and there is over a yearâ€™s worth of development to realize this goal.

!!! note
    CIO CI/CD implements image signing and **verification** at scale with Cirrus.  Verification is proof required by ITSS.

## General Guidance

!!! note
    To get an idea of how a migration works, check out this [10 minute video](https://ibm.box.com/s/e1kgzzpiszemj8ds6e2ldmscja5q9759){target=\_blank} showing tips for a migration from Travis to CIO CI/CD (Spring Boot application).

The primary suite of pipelines that exist today are Java, Node and Python based.  **Read our [Decision page](./decision.md) which lists all of them and is kept up-to-date.**

Broadly speaking, pipelines are divided into two categories: official and community.  Community pipelines have been built by InnerSource and some official pipelines have been built by InnerSource as well.  This distinction is important because the CIO CI/CD team is small and relies  on InnerSource to be successful especially for the migration.

Another distinction are compliance vs container pipelines.  Compliance pipelines do not perform deployment.  They meet only a subset of ITSS chapter 5 requirements. Using them on their own can be helpful, but they are a stepping stone to the full CI/CD pipelines.

!!! note
    Community pipelines may indicate that they do not meet your level of support.  If so, please list your [BCV level](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/application-management-from-dev2prod/documentation/business-continuity-management){target=\_blank} in [this issue](https://github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog/issues/1062){target=\_blank}.  CIO CI/CD is not requiring teams to change their BCV level.

Following these steps to get engaged with CIO CI/CD:

1. Bookmark our [W3Publisher page](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cio-ci-cd){target=\_blank}, note the links on the bottom left to our technical documentation and register for the Office Hours, Feature Presention and Blog.

1. Post a message in our support channel, [#dx-platform-support](https://my.slack.com/archives/C02AM16DR19){target=\_blank} with technical detail describing your application listing and any gaps in CIO CI/CD.

2. Our team will try to solve your needs with our current offering or direct you to our [InnerSource process](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog-docs/#getting-started){target=\_blank}, which explains how to submit a new request.

Many teams are requesting [multi-project](https://github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog/issues/1029){target=\_blank} and [multi-region](https://github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/ciocicd-project-board/issues/1236){target=\_blank} support.  Those are enhancements to our [Container Release Management](./container-release.md) feature, and are top priorities. Feel free to add your comments to the above Github issues.

!!! note
    Please see our [Features and Roadmap](./features-roadmap.md#innersource) page for a list of InnerSource contributions in development.  If you don't see the pipeline you need there or on our [Pipeline Decision](./decision.md) page, consider opening a new contribution via our [InnerSource process](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog-docs/#getting-started).  Also, consider offering help on current InnerSource contributions to accelerate development.

## Specific Guidance

### S2i
Follow the above [General Guidance](#general-guidance) documentation.  Ruby users follow and comment on [this Github issue](https://github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog/issues/830){target=\_blank} in our team's backlog.  GoLang users do the same for [this Github issue](https://github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog/issues/263){target=\_blank}.

### BYOI
Review the [list of available pipelines](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/documentation/decision/){target=\_blank} to verify if CIO CI/CD fits your needs or if you are able to board by changing your current processes.  If your application is not a fit, submit your automation as an [InnerSource request](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog-docs#getting-started){target=\_blank} and a CIO CI/CD team member will contact you for evaluation. Continue to check this page for updates and monitor our support channel: [#dx-platform-support](https://my.slack.com/archives/C02AM16DR19){target=\_blank}.  Additional guidance and process will be available soon.  Bring your inquiries to our [Office Hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10272011?layout=grid){target=\_blank} as well.

!!! Note
    You may notice in our documentation that CIO CI/CD deployes images using BYOI.  This will be going away as CIO CI/CD will become a trusted integration with Cirrus.

### DockerFile
One design goal for CIO CI/CD is consistency and therefore it does not support DockerFile.  DockerFile allows a high level of customization which is not possible to implement or support in a single system.  In addition, ITSS compliance is challenging and most often not possible with Dockerfile.  We have received input from a number of adopters and as a result created the following [DockerFile guidance](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cio-ci-cd/dockerfile-guidance){target=\_blank} page.  Also, we encourage you to bring inquiries to our [Office Hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10272011?layout=grid){target=\_blank}.

### Deployment Targets
CIO CI/CD supports Cirrus and z/OS deployments.  If this does not fit your needs, we welcome InnerSource requests.  See our [contribution guidance](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog-docs/){target=\_blank}.

### Build-time environment variables
For security purposes, CIO CI/CD has a prescriptive approach to the usage of build-time environment variables.  Read our [Guidance on Build-time Environment Variables](./guidance-env-vars.md) page for more information.

## Community Channels
IBM-wide Slack channels exist for each community pipeline to facilitate collaboration between maintainers and users.  If you need to make an enhancement to board the pipeline or otherwise, an [InnerSource contribution](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cio-ci-cd/pipeline-catalog-docs/){target=\_blank} is required.  If you are going to make the contribution, post a message in the channel and make sure you receive acknowledgement from a community maintainer.
